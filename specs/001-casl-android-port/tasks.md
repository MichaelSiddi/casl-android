# Tasks: CASL Android Authorization Library

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-casl-android-port/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in feature specification. Test tasks are excluded per project guidelines.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Android Library project structure:
- **Library module**: `casl/src/main/kotlin/com/casl/`
- **Test module**: `casl/src/test/kotlin/com/casl/`
- **Sample app**: `sample/src/main/kotlin/com/casl/sample/`
- **Build configs**: `build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`

### Within Each User Story

- User Story 1: All tasks can run sequentially, T017-T018 can start in parallel
- User Story 2: RuleIndex implementation (T028-T037) must complete before Ability methods (T038-T045)
- User Story 3: All tasks are enhancements to existing classes, can mostly run in parallel
- User Story 4: Single method implementation, sequential execution
- User Story 5: All extension files [P] parallelizable, API review sequential

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 1: Tasks T006, T007, T008 marked [P] can run in parallel
- Phase 2: Tasks T010, T011 marked [P] can run in parallel with T009
- Phase 5: Tasks T062, T063 marked [P] can start in parallel
- Phase 8: All tasks marked [P] are independent
- Phase 9: All tasks marked [P] are independent
- Phase 10: All tasks marked [P] are independent
- Phase 11: Most tasks marked [P] are independent

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Define Rules)

```bash
# Start in parallel:
Task T017: "Create AbilityBuilder class skeleton"
Task T018: "Create Ability class skeleton"

# Then sequentially:
Task T019-T027: "Implement builder methods and companion functions"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Check Permissions)

```bash
# RuleIndex implementation (sequential):
Task T028-T037: "Implement RuleIndex with indexing and lookup logic"

# Then Ability methods (sequential, depends on RuleIndex):
Task T038-T045: "Implement can/cannot methods using RuleIndex"
```

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 10 (Quality & Performance)

```bash
# All benchmarks and tests can run in parallel:
Task T091: "Permission check latency benchmark"
Task T092: "Concurrent access benchmark"
Task T093: "Serialization performance benchmark"
Task T094: "Memory profiling test"
Task T095: "Stress test: 10k concurrent operations"
Task T096-T099: "Edge case and correctness tests"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup ‚Üí Project structure ready
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational ‚Üí Utilities ready (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 ‚Üí Rules can be defined
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 ‚Üí Permissions can be checked
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test rule definition + permission checking independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready ‚Üí **This is a functional authorization library MVP**

### Incremental Delivery

1. **MVP (US1 + US2)**: Define rules + check permissions ‚Üí Core authorization works
2. **+ US3**: Add JSON serialization ‚Üí Dynamic rule loading from backend
3. **+ US4**: Add runtime updates ‚Üí Real-time permission changes
4. **+ US5**: Add language compatibility ‚Üí Full Java/Kotlin parity
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Phase 1 + 2 together** (Setup + Foundation)
2. Once Phase 2 done:
   - **Developer A**: Phase 3 (US1: Define Rules)
   - **Developer B**: Phase 8 (Sample App), Phase 9 (Build Config) - can start early
3. After Phase 3 (US1) completes:
   - **Developer A**: Phase 4 (US2: Check Permissions)
4. After Phase 4 (US2) completes:
   - **Developer A**: Phase 5 (US3: Serialize)
   - **Developer B**: Phase 7 (US5: Compatibility)
   - **Developer C**: Phase 6 (US4: Update Rules)
5. After all user stories:
   - **Team**: Phase 10 (Quality) in parallel, then Phase 11 (Polish)

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Test tasks excluded**: Not requested in feature specification
- **Each user story is independently testable**: US1 can be validated without US2, etc.
- **Thread-safety critical**: Volatile reads, synchronized writes pattern throughout
- **Zero dependencies**: Only org.json from Android SDK, no external libraries
- **Performance targets**: <1ms permission checks, 1000+ concurrent ops, <10ms serialization
- **Package size limit**: <100KB AAR (verified in Phase 9, Task T086)
- **Feature parity goal**: Match iOS CASL library behavior (verified in Phase 10)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
