# Specification Quality Checklist: CASL Android Authorization Library

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASSED** - Specification maintains focus on WHAT and WHY without implementation details. Written in business-friendly language describing authorization capabilities and user needs.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASSED** - All 20 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. Success criteria include specific measurable metrics (e.g., "under 1 millisecond", "1000 concurrent checks", "100 KB package size").

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASSED** - Five prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) with independent test criteria. Edge cases comprehensively identified. Scope clearly bounded to authorization library functionality. Dependencies noted (Android API level 21+, zero external dependencies).

### Success Criteria Technology-Agnostic Check
✅ **PASSED** - All success criteria focus on measurable outcomes:
- User-facing metrics (code brevity, integration success)
- Performance metrics (milliseconds, concurrent operations, package size)
- Quality metrics (crash rate, documentation coverage)
- Feature parity (behavioral equivalence with iOS library)

No technology-specific details leak into success criteria.

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to proceed with implementation planning.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories enables incremental delivery
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Well-defined thread-safety and concurrency requirements
- Measurable success criteria with specific targets
- Strong focus on developer experience (Java/Kotlin compatibility)

**Recommendations for Planning Phase**:
- Consider Android-specific concurrency patterns (Handler/Looper vs. Kotlin coroutines)
- Plan for reflection vs. code generation approaches for subject type detection
- Design JSON serialization strategy (Gson, Moshi, manual, or kotlinx.serialization)
- Consider Gradle module structure for library distribution
